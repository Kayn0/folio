                  <p class="project-font-white">My impactful contributions as a Frontend Developer working on the Nookal Platform have been critical to the successful delivery of numerous projects. From creating an inventory and invoicing systems, to implementing subscriptions, bulk invoicing, and purchasing credits flow. I have demonstrated my deep technical expertise and dedication to quality.</p>
                  <p class="project-font-white">I have also crafted a comprehensive style guide in React that serves as a valuable resource for ensuring design consistency. I moved into the role of Design Lead, a pivotal position in which I oversee development and ensure that it aligns with the overarching design vision, whilst providing guidance and mentorship to other developers. I utilise my technical coding skills with multiple languages including JavaScript, React, PHP, SCSS and HTML.</p>

                    <h6 class="project-font-white">User Research</h6>
                    <p class="project-font-white">My research process began with an in-depth analysis of user surveys, client requests, and competitor booking platforms. This provided me with valuable insights into the challenges our clients face when setting up their online booking system and the pain points that their end users encounter while making online bookings.</p>
                    <p class="project-font-white">Since our online booking platform already has a large customer base, I sought feedback from both our clients and their customers to gather even more valuable insights. These were then used to develop requirements that would address the issues identified in the research. Here is a small sample:</p>

                    <div class="box style-4">The current system is outdated in terms of look, feel and functionality.</div>

                        <h6>Design Constraints</h6>
                        <p class="project-font-grey">At the time of redesign, the current online booking system was being used for hundreds of bookings each day. Therefore any changes to existing functionality needed to be carefully considered. Understanding this early in the design process, ensured that proposed solutions were viable from a technical perspective.</p>
                        <p class="project-font-grey">From the research I gathered I was able to collate the results into different client perspectives. I used these client perspectives to create several personaâ€™s, which ensured design solutions remained focused.</p>

                <p class="project-font-white">With the research I had conducted and a deep understanding of current booking platform trends, I initiated an iterative design process. I started with low-resolution mockups and progressively refining them to high-resolution designs and prototypes, integrating new features and improving user flow. Throughout this I conducted workshops with key clients to obtain feedback on the proposed solutions. </p>
